typscript is inhande of js & it will not compiled in brouser so it will convert into js at last 
we write typescript code ---------> it compiled and convert in js --------->then it run on brouser

Q why again we are convering typescript into js then why would we not write js code only ?
Ans: becouse  when we are using typescript we can cheak error at compiled time only but in js type error will come at runtime and we can not define all veriable type from before


# with typescript we add objectOrianted programing also this help us to make classes,interface, clasess inside function that leads to manage over code .

Q why to use tyopescript?
ex:= 
function add(num1,num2)
{
    retunr num1+num2;
}
console.log(add('2','3'))// '23' // whare we not sure will output 5 or 23 just becouse of typeisnotdegine.
so by typescript we predefine type of number.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

how to install typescript 
"npm insts"

#spellcheck used for spalling cheak
#"material icon theme" this will put icon for every file which give better understing about file & folder

#Three main type in typescript:- 
number:- which take 12,13.4
string:- which take 'a',"a",`a`
boolean:- which take true & false


# what is type inference ?
ex: let a = 10; // in typescript if you define like this it not take any other value in "a" except number.
but we define like this 
let data; // so what its type ? its type is any mena you can assine any type of value in it .

# you can make "spacific number type variable" also mena you can  not assine any other value excapt this:-
ex:-  let data:5=5; // its ok but if you assine other then 5 it give error 
data = 10; // error 

#const data = 10; // hear type itself become 10 becouse we can not change value of data.


#Object-Type use of define type of value it will take 
Ex:- const user:{name:string;age:number;email:string}={name:"anil",age:12,email:"pradhumnchoubey@gmail.com"}
console.log(user.name);
but you have another object which have smae values like this upper object so Value is dublicate in both object how to solve it ??
by:-
type objType={name:string;age:number;email:string}
const person:objType={
    name:"anil",
    age:12,
    email:"pradhumnchoubey@gmail.com"
}
const son:objType={
    name:"rohon",
    age:2,
    email:"pradhumnchoubey@gmail.com"
}
if grup of object have some veraible we can define there type like this.


#ArrayType:- you now js array will take all type of data but if you want to insert one type of data onely you can make it posible 
Ex= let arr:[string]=["ram","shyam","sita","gita"]; // but it will not take any other type of value 
but js array will take any type of data in that case you use "any" 
Ex= let newArray:any[]=["abc",123,true]; // it will take all type of data.
alos if over array only have two type of data let's say number & string you can dafine like this 
Ex= let arr:string[] | number[]=["ram","shyam","sita","gita"]; // it will take only two type of data 


#Tuple:- it is kind of array only but more advanced we can define each value type 
Ex:- let role:[string,string,number,number,boolean?] = ['admin','manager',1,3] // hear we define boolean? becouse at present no value for boolean 
and all this type is define in sequence and length is fixed 
role.push(true)// now we are adding boolean value
role[1]=10; // it give error 

#enum :- it will assine number to each element in it
Ex: enum Role{Admin,manager,reasonly,boss}
console.log(Role.1) // Admin like this it will give value for each numbers second we can access all value by . all values will come


#Any:- suppose you are geting data from api but you don't know the type of it then you cna use "any"
you can use "any" with array also  "let data:any=[10,20];"
but we not use "any" most offen

#union:- if we are not which data will come between two or three type data or more you use "union"
Ex:- function combine(a:number|string,b:number|string)
     {if(typeof a === 'number' && typeof b ==='number'){retunr a+b;}else{return a.toString() + b.toString()}};
     console.log(combine(10,20));
     console.log(combine("shyam","choubey"));

# if you now which type of value will come use "union" if you have no idea use "any"


#Literal type:-it is simmeler to union but in union we define data but in Literal we assine values.
ex:- function add(type:"rohon"|"sohon")
{
    if(type == "rohon")console.log("hello");
    else if(type == "sohon")console.log("hii");
}
if we pass any other value except this two value it give error 


#Type_alias:- it is union only but we create one veriable of it and use so we not want to more code 
EX:- type varType = stirng | number | undefiend;
let a : varType = 10;
let b : varType = "hello";
let c : varType = undefiend;

#what is function type:- the type of value define by function as "retunr" is called functiontype
EX:- function f1():number
     {
         return 20;
     }
so
